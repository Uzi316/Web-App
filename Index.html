        <p>
        In Punjab (Pakistan), the increasing population and expansion of land use for agriculture have severely exploited the regional groundwater resources. 
        Intensive pumping has resulted in a rapid decline in the level of the water table as well as its quality. 
        Better management practices and artificial recharge are needed for the development of sustainable groundwater resources. 
        The objective of this study is to delineate the groundwater potential zones of this area using Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques.
        Weighted overlay analysis was used to demarcate the groundwater potential zones. Various thematic layers such as geology, slope, soil, lineament density, drainage density, rainfall and land use maps were prepared. 
        The final groundwater potential map was prepared by assigning appropriate weightage to different thematic maps and adding them to the final groundwater potential map. 
        Maps of favorable groundwater potential recharge zones are helpful for planning and implementation of wells and hydraulic structures in this region.

            Groundwater is the largest fresh water resource on the Earth, which makes it an important source for human consumption and the overall development of a region.
            Mapping groundwater potential zones is essential for planning the location of new abstraction wells to meet the increasing demand for water. 
            The occurrence, distribution, and movement of groundwater mainly depend upon the geological and hydro-geomorphological features of the area.
            A detailed study of groundwater occurrences can be made by surface and subsurface investigation methods. 
            High-resolution satellite imageries are widely used in groundwater studies due to their high spectral and spatial resolution. 
            They are used to identify the geology, slope, soil, lineament density, drainage density, rainfall and landuse for maps that indicate the occurrence of groundwater. 
            Population growth and the expansion of agricultural lands has mounted increasing pressure on groundwater resources, resulting in their overexploitation as well as a deteriorating in water quality. 
            In Pakistan, the contribution of groundwater to overall irrigation water supply increased from 8% in 1960 to 60% in 2010 as a consequence of the continuous increase of lands under cultivation; 
            the 2–3 m annual decline of the water table is due to continuous pumping of fresh aquifers to meet domestic and agriculture-related water demands. Much of the area under cultivation in the Punjab province of Pakistan is irrigated using groundwater withdrawn from dug wells and tube wells. 
            The number of tube-wells installed here increased from 100,000 in 1975 to 800,000 in 2014. 
            As the aquifer is unconfined in nature the increasing population and other anthropogenic activities pose an environmental risk. 
            A careful assessment of the groundwater aquifer system is essential for its sustainable management. 
            Potential groundwater recharge mapping can assist water resource managers to make better management plans.

                <p class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">The study area is in Punjab which is the second largest 
                    province of Pakistan. It occupies an area of about 205,344 km2, which is 25.8% of 
                    the total land area of Pakistan. It extends between longitude 70°E–75°E and latitude 
                    28°N–38°N, and its elevation decreases from 2271 m in the north to 46 m in the south. 
                    The climate of this region shows a fluctuating trend in temperature and precipitation 
                    with average values of 33 °C and 59 cm/yr., respectively. 
                    The Indus River and five of its main tributaries – the Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, 
                    and Sutlej flow through this region. Many surface water channels including link canals 
                    (which transport water from western rivers to eastern rivers), main canals, and their tributaries were constructed to irrigate agricultural crops in this region. 
                    Punjab is among the more fertile provinces of Pakistan and is rich in groundwater resources;
                    more than 80% of nationwide groundwater resources occur in this region. However, the rate of groundwater depletion is high in response to the rapid expansion of agricultural land, 
                    increasing population growth, and widespread installation of private tube-wells. 
                    Estimates suggest that groundwater, either alone or together with canal water, 
                    accounts for approximately 69% of the water used to irrigate crops.</p>

                     Landuse/Land cover patterns provide information about infiltration and runoff,

                    sand and rocks called aquifers. 
                    That is why it is important to know what geological features make up our area and which have 
                    higher infiltration rate.  Water fills the pores and fractures in underground materials such as sand, 
                    gravel, and other rock, much the same way that water fills a sponge. 
                    If groundwater flows naturally out of rock materials or if it can be removed by pumping 
                    (in useful amounts),
